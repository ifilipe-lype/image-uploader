This is an app solution for a challenge in <a href="https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx">devchallenges</a> website

It was fun to embrace the challenge and endure the struggle of the unkown.
I gotta admit a felt awesome while completing the user' stories from the requirements list

I've learned a lot in the process of coming up with a solution, here's an sample:
  - how to check file type, file size,
  - how to Drag & Drop
  - how integrate cloudinary api
  - build an rest api endpoint in nextjs
  - animation with css & tailwindcss

- My wisdom? Well! Never be afraid of challenges, embrace the struggle and keep going
